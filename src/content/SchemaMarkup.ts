  faqs: [
    {
      q: "How quickly do rich results appear after schema implementation?",
      a: "Google typically processes and tests new schema markup within 1-4 weeks of implementation, depending on schema type and page crawl frequency. FAQ and Review rich results typically appear within 2-3 weeks. Product rich results within 1-3 weeks. Organisation and LocalBusiness improvements reflected in knowledge panels and AI search within 4-8 weeks. Rich result activation is not guaranteed for every page — Google's algorithms determine eligibility based on content quality and schema accuracy.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does schema markup directly improve ranking positions?",
      a: "Schema markup does not directly improve ranking positions the way link acquisition or content quality improvements do. Its primary commercial impact is through improved click-through rate from existing positions — generating more organic traffic from the same ranking position by making the result more visually prominent and more informative. Indirectly, improved CTR signals to Google that the result is satisfying user intent, which can positively influence ranking over time.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between JSON-LD and Microdata schema?",
      a: "JSON-LD is Google's recommended schema implementation format — injected into page's head as a separate script block, no changes required to visible HTML. Microdata embeds schema properties directly into HTML elements. JSON-LD is preferred for cleaner implementation, easier maintenance, and Google's explicit recommendation. We implement schema exclusively in JSON-LD format.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can incorrect schema markup hurt rankings?",
      a: "Incorrect schema that misrepresents page content — Review schema on pages without actual reviews, or Product schema with fabricated pricing — violates Google's structured data policies and can result in manual actions that suppress rich results or, in severe cases, affect organic rankings. Incorrect schema with syntax errors or missing properties will fail to generate rich results but won't cause active ranking penalties. Our implementation includes testing against Google's Rich Results Test before deployment.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you maintain schema markup after implementation?",
      a: "Yes — schema requires ongoing maintenance because page content changes (new FAQs added, prices updated, reviews accumulated, services added) must be reflected in structured data. Stale or inaccurate schema is a policy compliance risk. We provide schema maintenance as part of our ongoing technical SEO retainer or as a standalone quarterly review service.",
