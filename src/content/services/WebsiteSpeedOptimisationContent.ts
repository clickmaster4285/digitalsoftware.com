    solution:
      "THE CONVERSION COST\nEvery additional second of mobile load time reduces conversion rate. The research is consistent across studies: Walmart reported a 2% increase in conversion for every 1 second of improvement in load time. Amazon estimated that 100 milliseconds of additional latency costs 1% in sales. Vodafone reported a 31% increase in sales after a 31% improvement in Largest Contentful Paint. These are not edge cases — they are the expected business outcomes of the expected relationship between load time and conversion rate.\n\nOn a website generating £50,000 per month with a 4-second mobile load time, a 2-second improvement (to 2 seconds) may conservatively produce a 15-25% conversion rate improvement — translating directly into £7,500 to £12,500 per month in additional revenue from identical traffic.\n\nTHE SEO COST\nGoogle incorporated Core Web Vitals as a ranking factor in its Page Experience update. The three metrics — Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Interaction to Next Paint (INP), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) — are measured and assessed for every page Google indexes, and pages that achieve Good ratings in all three metrics receive a ranking advantage over equivalent pages with Poor ratings.\n\nFor a website spending £5,000 per month on SEO, a significant portion of that investment is being undermined if the website's Core Web Vitals are in the Poor or Needs Improvement ranges — because the content and link-building investments that drive organic rankings are competing at a structural disadvantage against competitors with faster, better-performing pages.\n\nTHE PAID ADVERTISING COST\nGoogle Ads' Quality Score — the metric that determines cost per click and ad rank in Google's search auction — is partly determined by the landing page experience score, which includes page load speed and Core Web Vitals performance. A website with poor page speed pays more per click for the same position, gets worse ad placement for the same bid, and converts the traffic it does receive at a lower rate.\n\nThe double penalty of higher CPCs and lower conversion rates on slow landing pages makes slow websites dramatically less efficient paid advertising platforms. Businesses with slow websites are systematically overpaying for the leads and customers their advertising generates.",

For most business websites in 2026, a score above 90 on mobile (the more challenging and more important target) is the appropriate performance goal. Desktop scores are typically 15-25 points higher than mobile scores for the same website, and mobile is the metric that matters most given that 65%+ of website traffic is mobile.",

INP (Interaction to Next Paint) measures how quickly the page responds to user interactions — Good is under 200 milliseconds. CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) measures visual stability — Good is under 0.1. Google incorporated Core Web Vitals as a ranking signal in its Page Experience update — pages that achieve Good ratings across all three metrics receive a ranking advantage over equivalent pages with Poor or Needs Improvement ratings.

      a: "A focused speed optimisation engagement for an existing website typically takes 2-4 weeks: 3-5 days for performance audit and diagnosis, 5-10 days for implementation of the optimisations, and 2-3 days for testing and verification of results. More complex engagements — involving hosting migration, significant codebase changes, or custom caching infrastructure — take 4-6 weeks. The implementation timeline depends significantly on the website's platform (WordPress optimisation is well-understood and fast to implement; custom framework optimisation may require more investigation time) and the depth of the performance problems identified.",

WordPress speed optimisation for a standard business website typically costs $2,000 to $4,000. E-commerce speed optimisation (with the additional WooCommerce or Shopify-specific optimisations) typically costs $3,000 to $6,000. For websites requiring hosting migration as part of the optimisation, the hosting migration adds scope and cost. We provide fixed-price proposals after the initial audit.",

    {
      q: "Does website speed affect mobile more than desktop?",
      a: "Yes — mobile performance is significantly more challenging than desktop performance and significantly more important given that 65%+ of web traffic is mobile. Mobile devices have less processing power than desktop computers (limiting JavaScript execution speed), mobile network connections are less reliable and lower-bandwidth than desktop broadband (amplifying the cost of large page payloads), and mobile users are more likely to be in fragmented attention environments where slow pages are abandoned rather than waited for. Google's PageSpeed score is calculated separately for mobile and desktop, and mobile scores are typically 15-25 points lower than desktop scores for the same website. Mobile performance is the correct primary target for speed optimisation.",
