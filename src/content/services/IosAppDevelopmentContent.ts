  faqs: [
    {
      q: "When should I build a native iOS app rather than a cross-platform app?",
      a: "Native iOS development is the right choice when: your target audience is primarily iOS users (common in the USA, UK, and Australia where iOS has 50-60% market share, and in premium consumer and enterprise categories where iOS adoption is highest); your app requires deep Apple platform integration (Face ID, Apple Pay, HealthKit, ARKit, Core ML, Apple Watch, or any platform API that cross-platform frameworks either do not support or support imperfectly); your competitive category demands best-in-category product quality (finance, healthcare, luxury retail) where the iOS experience quality gap is commercially significant; or your initial launch strategy is iOS-first to validate product-market fit before investing in Android.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between SwiftUI and UIKit and which do you use?",
      a: "UIKit is Apple's original iOS UI framework — mature, comprehensively documented, and the framework most iOS apps built before 2019 use. SwiftUI is Apple's modern declarative UI framework, introduced in 2019, that produces more readable code, faster UI development, and automatic support for iOS features like Dark Mode, Dynamic Type, and accessibility. For new projects in 2026, we use SwiftUI as the primary UI framework — it is Apple's current standard and produces better long-term maintainability. For projects with existing UIKit codebases, we work in UIKit with SwiftUI integration for new features. For complex custom animations or specific UIKit-only APIs, we use UIKit within a SwiftUI app where SwiftUI does not yet provide the necessary capability.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long does iOS app development take?",
      a: "A simple iOS utility app (limited features, no complex backend) typically takes 10-14 weeks from kick-off to App Store submission. A mid-complexity business app (e-commerce, booking, content) with backend integration typically takes 16-24 weeks. A complex enterprise or healthcare app with significant backend complexity and platform API integration typically takes 24-40 weeks. The App Store review process adds 1-3 business days after submission with potential additional time for rejections and resubmissions.",

    {
      q: "What does the App Store review process involve?",
      a: "Apple's review team evaluates every submitted app build against the App Store Review Guidelines — a detailed set of rules covering functionality (the app must be fully functional and useful), design (the app must follow iOS interface conventions), legal (privacy policy, data collection disclosure, age rating), business (in-app purchase implementations must follow StoreKit guidelines), and content (user-generated content moderation, prohibited content categories). About 40% of first submissions are rejected. Common rejection reasons include incomplete functionality in the submitted build, missing or incorrect privacy manifest declarations, privacy nutrition label inaccuracies, and in-app purchase guideline violations.",

A mid-complexity business app (e-commerce, booking, or service delivery with user accounts, payment, and push notifications) typically costs $70,000 to $180,000. A complex enterprise or healthcare app with significant backend complexity, deep platform API integration (HealthKit, ARKit, etc.), and enterprise security requirements typically costs $180,000 to $500,000. Costs vary significantly by project scope and backend complexity. We provide detailed estimates after a scoping consultation.",

Most engagements focus on iPhone as the primary platform, with iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac extensions developed as subsequent phases once the core iPhone product is validated.",

      q: "Can you update and maintain an existing iOS app?",
      a: "Yes — ongoing iOS app maintenance is a significant portion of our iOS practice. We take over maintenance of existing apps: reviewing the codebase and providing a technical health assessment, implementing iOS version compatibility updates for annual iOS releases, addressing App Store review guideline compliance issues that are causing rejection, and developing new features in ongoing development retainers.
