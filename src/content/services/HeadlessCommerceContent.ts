    ],
    solution:
      "THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE CEILING\nMonolithic e-commerce platforms produce customer experiences that are constrained by the platform's templating system. The Shopify theme that your development team has pushed to its limits with custom Liquid code. The Magento frontend that loads in 3.8 seconds despite years of optimisation because the rendering architecture has an inherent ceiling. The platform that technically supports the content personalisation you want to implement — but only through a plugin ecosystem that creates fragility and adds page weight.\n\nThese are not team capability problems. They are architectural constraints. The developer cannot make a templated storefront perform like a server-side rendered React application. The platform cannot produce the millisecond-level personalisation that a headless CMS with edge delivery can. The constraint is the architecture — and headless commerce is what removes it.\n\nTHE MULTI-CHANNEL PROBLEM\nModern retail is not a single channel. The brand that operates a D2C website, a marketplace presence, a mobile app, an in-store digital interface, and a social commerce integration is maintaining multiple customer experience surfaces — and a monolithic architecture means each surface is a compromise. The mobile app that is a wrapper around the mobile web experience because the platform API does not support the native app experience your customers expect. The in-store digital touchpoint that shows a different product data quality than the website because the two systems do not share a single source of truth.\n\nHeadless commerce's API-first architecture means the commerce back end — product data, pricing, inventory, orders — is available as a service to every channel simultaneously. The mobile app, the website, the kiosk, and the voice interface all draw from the same commerce API. Consistent data. Consistent experience quality. One source of truth.\n\nTHE VELOCITY PROBLEM\nEnterprise e-commerce teams consistently cite the speed of delivering front-end changes as one of their most significant operational frustrations. In a monolithic architecture, a front-end change that would take a React developer two hours to implement in isolation requires a backend deployment cycle, regression testing against the full platform, and coordination across multiple teams. The headless architecture decouples front-end velocity from back-end release cycles — the storefront team can deploy changes independently of the commerce back end, enabling the rapid iteration that modern e-commerce requires.",

The composable commerce stack typically combines: a headless commerce engine (Shopify Plus headless / Magento headless / Commercetools / VTEX), a headless CMS (Contentful, Sanity, Prismic, Storyblok), a front-end framework (Next.js or Nuxt.js), search infrastructure (Algolia or Elasticsearch), a payment platform (Stripe, Adyen, Braintree), and the API layer that connects these services.\n\nWe design headless commerce architectures based on the specific requirements of each business — selecting the right combination of best-of-breed services rather than imposing a single stack. The architecture phase covers: requirements analysis (current platform limitations, channel strategy, performance requirements, team technical capability), stack selection (matching each service category to the business's specific needs and technical context), integration architecture (designing the API connections and data flows between services), and infrastructure specification (hosting, CDN, serverless vs container architecture, caching strategy).",

We have delivered Next.js storefronts with Lighthouse scores of 95+ on mobile — categories the same product catalogue on a Shopify theme or Magento front end could not approach.\n\nCustom checkout experiences: Headless commerce allows the checkout experience to be built as a custom React application rather than constrained by the platform's checkout flow — enabling the specific UX, the embedded payment components, and the custom post-checkout experiences that enterprise brands require.\n\nContent-commerce integration: The editorial content and commerce product integration that produces the shoppable editorial experiences, the category pages with embedded brand storytelling, and the personalised product recommendations that headless architecture enables and monolithic platforms cannot produce without compromise.",

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "Is headless commerce right for my business?",
      a: "Headless commerce is appropriate when the monolithic platform's architectural constraints are materially limiting commercial outcomes — specifically: when page speed optimisation has reached the limits of what the current platform permits; when the marketing team needs content publishing independence that the current platform does not support; when you are launching on multiple channels simultaneously (web, mobile app, in-store, social commerce) and need each to reflect brand quality consistently; or when your personalisation and content-commerce integration requirements exceed what a templated storefront can deliver. For businesses generating less than $5M e-commerce revenue with standard catalogue complexity and single-channel operations, the investment in headless architecture typically does not produce proportionate commercial return versus a well-optimised monolithic platform.",
    },
    {
      q: "What does headless commerce development cost?",
      a: "Headless commerce implementations typically cost $80,000-$250,000 for a standard Next.js storefront on Shopify Plus or Magento with one headless CMS integration. Complex enterprise implementations with multiple channels, Commercetools, and custom commerce logic typically cost $250,000-$600,000+. Annual infrastructure and CMS licensing costs (Vercel, Contentful, Algolia, Commercetools) are an additional ongoing consideration. We provide detailed, fixed-price proposals following the architecture design phase.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long does a headless commerce implementation take?",
      a: "A standard headless implementation (Next.js storefront, one headless CMS, Shopify Plus or Magento back end) typically takes 20-32 weeks from architecture sign-off to launch. Complex implementations with Commercetools, multiple channels, and custom commerce logic typically take 32-52 weeks.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does headless commerce affect SEO?",
      a: "Headless commerce's impact on SEO depends entirely on the front-end implementation. Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) in Next.js produce the crawlable HTML that Google's search engine requires — and the performance improvements that headless architecture enables (faster page loads, better Core Web Vitals) directly benefit organic rankings. A headless storefront implemented with client-side rendering only (a Single Page Application) can have significant SEO problems because Google's crawler may not fully index JavaScript-rendered content. We implement Next.js with SSR/SSG specifically to ensure headless storefronts are SEO-optimised.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can you migrate our existing e-commerce store to headless without losing our current data and SEO?",
      a: "Yes — we design headless migrations that preserve both operational data (product catalogue, customer records, order history) and SEO equity (URL structure, 301 redirect mapping for any URL changes, search console monitoring post-launch). The migration approach maintains the existing commerce back end (Shopify Plus, Magento) and replaces only the front-end layer — meaning the product data, customer accounts, and SEO authority built in the existing platform are preserved.",
