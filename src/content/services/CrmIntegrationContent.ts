    solution:
      "THE DATA FRAGMENTATION PROBLEM\nEvery business tool your team uses — the marketing automation platform, the email marketing system, the website analytics, the customer support desk, the billing and subscription system, the product analytics — is generating intelligence about each customer relationship. That intelligence exists in each system's individual database. Without integration, it stays there — visible to the team that uses that specific tool, invisible to everyone else.\n\nThe sales rep who calls a customer does not know that the customer filed three support tickets last week and is showing signs of churn risk. The marketing team sending a promotional campaign does not know which contacts are currently in active sales conversations and should be suppressed from outbound marketing. The customer success manager reviewing account health does not have visibility into which features each customer is actively using and which they have never engaged with. Everyone has a partial view. No one has the complete picture. And decisions made on partial information produce worse outcomes than decisions made on complete information.\n\nTHE MANUAL DATA ENTRY PROBLEM\nWhen systems do not integrate, data synchronisation becomes a manual task — and manual data entry is expensive, inconsistent, and chronically incomplete. Sales reps who spend 15-20% of their working time on CRM data entry — logging calls, updating deal stages, recording meeting notes — are spending that time on administrative overhead rather than on sales activity. The data they do enter is entered after the fact, when memory has already degraded. The data they do not enter — because there are too many fields, the entry takes too long, or the system is not open when the interaction happens — never appears in the CRM at all.\n\nTHE REPORTING BLINDNESS PROBLEM\nMarketing wants to know which campaigns generate the most revenue. Sales wants to know which lead sources close at the highest rate. Leadership wants to know the customer acquisition cost by channel and the lifetime value by segment. None of these questions can be answered correctly without connecting the marketing data (channel, campaign, cost) to the CRM data (lead source, deal value, close rate) to the financial data (actual revenue, customer lifetime). When these systems are not integrated, the answers are assembled manually — from exports, from spreadsheets, from imperfect attribution — and they are always incomplete, always delayed, and always disputed.",

Without connecting the two systems, the business's view of its own revenue is split between an optimistic CRM forecast and a historical financial system record that does not explain where the revenue came from.\n\nWe integrate ERP and billing systems (Xero, QuickBooks, Sage, NetSuite, Stripe) with the CRM: syncing invoice status and payment data to the CRM deal record (enabling the sales team to see whether their closed deals have actually been paid), connecting subscription billing events to CRM lifecycle stages (syncing renewal dates, MRR changes, and plan tier changes from the billing system to the CRM), and enabling the closed-loop revenue attribution reporting that connects marketing campaign spend to actual collected revenue.",

A multi-system integration (CRM connected to marketing automation, support desk, and billing system) typically takes 6-10 weeks. A custom API integration for a proprietary or non-standard system typically takes 4-8 weeks depending on the API complexity and documentation quality. Data quality remediation, if required, adds 2-4 weeks before integration implementation begins.",

      q: "What is a bidirectional sync and why does it matter?",
      a: "A bidirectional sync shares data between two systems in both directions — changes in System A update System B, and changes in System B update System A. A unidirectional sync only flows data one way. For CRM integrations, bidirectional sync is typically required because both teams (marketing and sales) update the shared data from their respective systems: marketing updates contact lifecycle stages and engagement data from the marketing platform, while sales updates deal stages and contact information from the CRM. Unidirectional sync produces the scenario where changes made in one system are overwritten by outdated data from the other.",

      q: "What happens when two systems have conflicting data for the same field?",
      a: "Conflict resolution is a critical design decision in any bidirectional CRM integration. We define the authoritative source for each data field as part of the integration architecture: for some fields (email address, phone number), the CRM is typically the authoritative source and marketing platform data defers to it. For other fields (lead score, campaign engagement data), the marketing platform is authoritative. For fields that both systems might legitimately update (notes, lifecycle stage), we define the conflict resolution rule — typically \"most recently updated wins\" with a timestamp comparison — and test it explicitly during integration configuration.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do you handle data privacy compliance in CRM integrations?",
      a: "CRM integrations that move personal data between systems must comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable data protection regulations — particularly consent and opt-out synchronisation. We implement consent and preference data synchronisation: unsubscribe events from email marketing platforms sync immediately to the CRM to prevent re-subscription from other system triggers; GDPR right-to-erasure requests handled in one system trigger deletion across all connected systems; data processing purpose limitations enforced by restricting which data fields are synchronised between systems to what is necessary for the integration's function. We work with clients' legal teams to ensure integration designs comply with applicable data protection requirements.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can you integrate a legacy system with no API?",
      a: "Legacy systems without modern REST APIs present integration challenges that require alternative approaches: database-level integration (reading and writing directly to the legacy system's database, bypassing the application layer), file-based integration (using the legacy system's export/import capabilities — CSV, XML, EDI — with automated file processing to move data between systems), screen-scraping (automated interaction with the legacy system's user interface, appropriate for systems where no other option exists), or middleware solutions that provide API access to legacy systems. We assess the integration options available for each legacy system and recommend the approach that balances reliability, maintainability, and implementation cost.",

Integration monitoring dashboards give the operations team visibility into integration health, and automated alerts surface integration problems before they affect business operations.",

A multi-system integration connecting three to five platforms with custom field mapping and workflow configuration typically costs $12,000 to $30,000. Custom API integration for non-standard systems typically costs $15,000 to $50,000 depending on API complexity. Enterprise integrations with high data volumes, complex transformation requirements, and middleware platform implementation typically cost $40,000 to $150,000.
