Last-click attribution says paid search drove it. First-click attribution says organic search drove it. Your Facebook Ads dashboard says Facebook drove it. Your Google Ads dashboard says Google drove it. All of them are right about something. None of them is right about everything.",

The result is a marketing portfolio that is systematically skewed toward the channels with the highest apparent last-click efficiency — not the channels that drive the highest actual incremental revenue.

We implement Shapley value attribution models: extracting the complete touchpoint path data from GA4, the CRM, and any offline conversion sources, training the attribution model on the historical conversion path data, and producing the per-channel credit allocation that forms the basis for channel investment decisions.",

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "What is marketing attribution and why does it matter?",
      a: "Marketing attribution is the process of determining which marketing activities contributed to a conversion or sale — and in what proportion. It matters because marketing budget decisions are only as good as the measurement informing them. If attribution incorrectly credits one channel with conversions that were actually driven by another, budget decisions based on that attribution will systematically misallocate investment: under-funding the channels that actually drive revenue and over-funding the channels that appear to drive revenue because they appear in an advantaged position in the attribution model. Getting attribution right is the prerequisite for making marketing investment decisions that actually improve marketing ROI.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between last-click, first-click, and multi-touch attribution?",
      a: "Last-click attribution assigns 100% of conversion credit to the final marketing touchpoint before conversion — the most common default model, but one that systematically over-credits lower-funnel channels (paid search, retargeting) and ignores all the touchpoints that built the awareness and intent that made the conversion possible. First-click attribution assigns 100% of conversion credit to the first touchpoint — correcting last-click's bias toward lower-funnel channels but ignoring all subsequent touchpoints. Multi-touch attribution distributes credit across all touchpoints that contributed to the conversion, using various methodologies (linear, time-decay, position-based, data-driven, Shapley) to determine the distribution. Multi-touch attribution is more accurate than single-touch models but requires more sophisticated data infrastructure.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is Marketing Mix Modelling and how is it different from multi-touch attribution?",
      a: "Multi-touch attribution operates at the individual-session level — it tracks individual users across touchpoints and assigns credit based on their specific conversion paths. MMM operates at the aggregate level — it uses statistical modelling on aggregate spend, impressions, and revenue data to identify channel contributions without requiring individual-level tracking. MMM can measure offline channels (TV, radio, print) that individual-level tracking cannot capture. It is appropriate for businesses with 18+ months of multi-channel data and provides a complementary view to multi-touch attribution — where MTA provides channel and campaign-level optimisation guidance, MMM provides portfolio-level budget allocation guidance.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I deal with the duplicate attribution problem across platforms?",
      a: "Each advertising platform uses its own attribution window and methodology, and each claims full credit for any conversion that occurred within its attribution window after an ad interaction. The result is that the sum of platform-reported conversions significantly exceeds actual conversions. The solutions: implement a single-source attribution model in GA4 (which provides a unified view across all traffic sources using a consistent methodology), use MMM for portfolio-level attribution (which avoids individual-level tracking issues entirely), and create a reconciliation view that compares GA4 attributed conversions to CRM or financial system actual conversions and quantifies the gap — treating the gap as measurement noise to be understood rather than performance to be optimised.",

    {
      q: "How does iOS 14+ affect marketing attribution?",
      a: "Apple's App Tracking Transparency framework (iOS 14.5+) requires apps to obtain user permission before tracking their activity across other apps and websites. The majority of iOS users do not grant this permission — reducing the signal available to platforms like Meta for attribution and audience targeting. The impact: Meta (and other affected platforms) can no longer accurately attribute all conversions from iOS traffic, resulting in under-reporting of conversions, deterioration of algorithm optimisation quality, and a widening gap between platform-reported performance and actual business performance. The remediation: server-side tracking (Meta CAPI), first-party data strategies, and measurement infrastructure that is less dependent on browser-level cookie tracking.",

      q: "How long does it take to implement improved attribution?",
      a: "Server-side tracking implementation (GTM Server-Side, Meta CAPI, Google Enhanced Conversions) typically takes 4-6 weeks. Multi-touch attribution implementation in GA4 with full cross-channel configuration typically takes 3-5 weeks. MMM implementation (data assembly, model development, scenario analysis) typically takes 8-12 weeks. A full unified measurement framework (combining server-side tracking, multi-touch attribution, and MMM) typically takes 12-20 weeks.
