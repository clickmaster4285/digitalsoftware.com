    solution:
      "PROGRAMMABLE SETTLEMENTS WITHOUT INTERMEDIARIES\nTraditional financial transactions require trusted intermediaries at every step: correspondent banks for cross-border transfers, clearing houses for securities settlements, escrow agents for conditional transactions. Each intermediary adds time (days for international wire transfers, two days for securities settlement), cost (fees that aggregate to significant amounts at scale), and counterparty risk (the risk that the intermediary fails or acts against the parties' interests).\n\nSmart contracts — self-executing code deployed on a blockchain — can replace specific intermediary functions with programmable logic: the escrow that releases funds automatically when delivery is confirmed, the financial instrument that pays coupon automatically when the trigger condition is met, the trading platform that settles transactions between parties instantly without a clearing house. The commercial value of removing intermediary cost and settlement delay is enormous at scale — and blockchain is the only infrastructure that makes it technically possible.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN PROVENANCE AND AUTHENTICITY\nSupply chains are trust problems: the retailer trusts the distributor's certificate of origin, which trusts the manufacturer's quality attestation, which trusts the raw material supplier's documentation. Each trust relationship is a potential fraud point — and a potential liability point when a product recall or quality incident requires tracing responsibility back through the chain.\n\nBlockchain supply chain solutions create an immutable provenance record: each event in the product's journey (manufacturing, quality testing, shipment, customs clearance, distribution) is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain, linked to the physical product via NFC chip or QR code, and verifiable by any party in the chain — or by the end consumer — without requiring access to any single party's proprietary records. The record cannot be altered by any participant in the chain without invalidating all subsequent records.\n\nDIGITAL OWNERSHIP AND TOKENISATION\nBlockchain enables a new category of asset: the digital asset with verifiable, transferable ownership that is enforced by cryptography rather than by legal contract. NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) extend this to unique digital assets — art, music, virtual real estate, in-game items — where ownership of the underlying digital file is a specific commercial proposition. Tokenisation extends it to real-world assets — real estate fractions, private equity shares, commodity inventories, intellectual property royalty streams — making illiquid assets divisible, tradeable, and accessible to investors who would not have the capital to purchase the underlying asset whole.",

Public blockchains are genuinely decentralised and trustless, but transactions are visible to all participants (with pseudonymity rather than privacy), transaction costs are variable and sometimes high, and throughput is constrained by the consensus mechanism. A permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric, Quorum) restricts participation to known, authorised entities — providing more control, privacy, and performance but at the cost of the genuine decentralisation that makes public blockchains trustless. The choice depends on whether the application needs genuine decentralisation (public) or controlled participation with privacy (permissioned).",
