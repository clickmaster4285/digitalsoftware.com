Seven distinct touchpoints across four channels — and last-click attribution gives 100% of the credit to the email. The Google Ads account reports zero value from the awareness campaign that prompted the initial TikTok search. Meta reports zero value from the video that introduced the brand. The email platform reports 100% of the revenue. Budget decisions made on this attribution produce the classic over-investment in last-click channels and under-investment in awareness — because the measurement system is systematically lying about which activity created the commercial outcome.",

Monthly reporting showed that direct traffic was the top revenue channel (34% of attributed revenue), suggesting strong brand awareness.

Result: The corrected attribution revealed that email was generating 28% of revenue (versus the 4% that GA4 had been reporting) and direct traffic was generating 8% (versus the 34% it appeared to be generating). Google Ads campaigns had been allocated 38% of the marketing budget partly because direct/brand traffic appeared weak — the reanalysis revealed they were actually generating a 4.2x ROAS rather than the 7.8x the misattributed reporting had suggested. Budget reallocation based on the corrected attribution produced an estimated £340,000 in annual efficiency improvement from the same budget.

Our analytics engagement: BigQuery implementation connecting Shopify order data to GA4 acquisition channel data, customer cohort analysis by acquisition channel and month, 12-month CLV calculation by channel, and the revised attribution framework that weighted channel performance by CLV-adjusted revenue rather than last-click transaction value.

It matters because e-commerce decisions — which products to promote, which marketing channels to invest in, which prices to set, which customers to target for retention — are all better when informed by accurate, specific, cross-channel data than when made on intuition or on incomplete platform-silo reporting. The stores that grow fastest are those that make evidence-based marketing and product decisions faster than their competitors.",

      q: "What is the difference between GA4 and Shopify Analytics for e-commerce?",
      a: "Shopify Analytics reports on orders and revenue using Shopify's own data — it is accurate for transaction data but does not include marketing attribution (which channel drove the session that converted), customer journey data (how many touchpoints occurred before purchase), or the session-level behaviour data (page views, scroll depth, on-site search) that GA4 provides. GA4 provides session-level behaviour and marketing attribution data but relies on accurate implementation to produce reliable e-commerce metrics. For complete e-commerce analytics, the two systems are complementary: Shopify Analytics for transaction accuracy, GA4 for behaviour and attribution. Connecting both in a data warehouse like BigQuery enables the combined analysis that neither provides alone.",

      a: "The simplest accuracy check: compare GA4 purchase events and revenue against your Shopify or WooCommerce order count and revenue for the same period. A discrepancy of more than 5-10% indicates a tracking problem. Common causes: double-firing purchase events (GA4 reports more purchases than actually occurred), missing purchase events (GA4 reports fewer purchases), and incorrect revenue values (GA4 revenue different from actual order value). We conduct analytics audits that systematically test every critical measurement point and identify the specific technical issues causing discrepancies.",

GA4's native interface aggregates and summarises this data, limiting the analyses available to the pre-built reports and the exploration tool's capabilities. BigQuery provides access to the raw data, enabling the custom SQL analysis that answers the specific commercial questions e-commerce businesses need to answer: which customers acquired through which channels have the highest 12-month LTV, which product combinations are most commonly purchased together, and what is the true multi-touch attributed revenue of each marketing channel across the full customer journey.

      q: "What is customer lifetime value and why does it matter for marketing?",
      a: "Customer lifetime value (CLV or LTV) is the total revenue a business expects to receive from a customer over their entire relationship with the brand. It matters for marketing because the acquisition cost a business can afford to pay for a new customer is determined by that customer's expected lifetime value, not just their first-purchase value. A customer who purchases once and never returns has a CLV equal to their first order. A customer who purchases six times per year for three years has a CLV of 18 transactions. If Google Shopping acquires mostly one-purchase customers and Facebook acquires mostly multi-purchase customers, the correct budget allocation prioritises Facebook — even if Facebook's last-click ROAS appears lower.",

      q: "How long does e-commerce analytics implementation take?",
      a: "A GA4 audit and remediation for an existing Shopify or WooCommerce store typically takes 2-4 weeks. A complete GA4 implementation from scratch (including server-side tracking and e-commerce event configuration) typically takes 3-6 weeks. A full data warehouse implementation (BigQuery, Shopify/WooCommerce data export, advertising data pipelines, and customer analytics dashboard) typically takes 8-14 weeks. Monthly analytics management retainers begin after the initial implementation is complete.",

      q: "How much does e-commerce analytics implementation cost?",
      a: "A GA4 audit and remediation typically costs $3,000-$8,000 depending on the complexity of the tracking issues identified. A complete GA4 implementation for Shopify or WooCommerce typically costs $5,000-$15,000. A full data warehouse and customer analytics implementation (BigQuery, ETL pipelines, LTV modelling, executive dashboards) typically costs $20,000-$60,000 for mid-market stores. Ongoing analytics management retainers (monthly implementation health checks, new feature implementation, reporting) typically cost $2,000-$6,000 per month.",
