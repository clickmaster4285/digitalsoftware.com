Impeller eliminates shader compilation jank — the frame drops that occurred when new shader combinations were encountered at runtime.

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "What is Flutter and how does it differ from React Native?",
      a: "Flutter is Google's open-source UI toolkit for building cross-platform applications from a single Dart codebase. The fundamental difference from React Native is the rendering approach: React Native renders native iOS and Android UI components (so the app looks native because it uses native components), while Flutter renders its own UI using the Impeller graphics engine (so the app looks identical on all platforms because Flutter draws every pixel itself). This difference has several implications: Flutter apps can achieve custom visual designs that native component libraries cannot express; Flutter's rendering performance is more consistent across devices; and Flutter's multi-platform support (iOS, Android, web, macOS, Windows, Linux) is architecturally cleaner than React Native's. React Native has the advantage of a larger ecosystem, more available developers, and JavaScript familiarity.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is Flutter's performance really comparable to native apps?",
      a: "For the majority of business app use cases, yes. Flutter's Impeller rendering engine (replacing Skia in Flutter 3.10+) eliminates shader compilation jank — Flutter's primary performance complaint — producing consistent 60-120fps rendering on supported devices. Flutter compiles to native ARM code (eliminating JavaScript runtime overhead that React Native carries), and Flutter's animation framework runs on the native UI thread via Dart's native compiled code. Independent benchmarks consistently show Flutter matching or exceeding React Native performance, and approaching native iOS and Android performance for most real-world app UI patterns. The remaining performance gap with native appears in very specific scenarios: apps with extremely complex custom rendering or apps requiring heavy use of very new platform APIs where Flutter's abstraction layer adds overhead.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is Dart and how difficult is it to learn?",
      a: "Dart is Google's programming language designed specifically for client-side development. It shares significant syntactic similarities with Java, Kotlin, C#, and TypeScript — developers experienced in any of these languages typically become productive in Dart within 1-2 weeks. Dart's null safety (mandatory since Dart 2.12) prevents an entire class of runtime errors at compile time, and its async/await model for asynchronous programming is clean and familiar to JavaScript developers. The primary learning investment for Dart is not the language syntax — it is Flutter's widget system and architecture patterns, which take 3-6 months to develop genuine expertise in.",
    },
    {
      q: "How does Flutter handle multi-platform deployment — can one codebase really target all six platforms?",
      a: "In principle, yes. In practice, the code sharing ratio varies by platform: Flutter mobile (iOS and Android) typically shares 95%+ of code between platforms, with only platform-specific navigation adaptations and plugin implementations differing. Flutter web shares 80-90% of code with mobile, with web-specific layouts and navigation patterns accounting for the remainder. Flutter desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux) shares 85-95% of code with mobile, with window management and keyboard/mouse interaction patterns requiring platform-specific work. The closer the target platforms are in their interaction model, the higher the code sharing ratio. Most Flutter engagements target iOS and Android primarily, with web and/or desktop as secondary targets where the business case justifies the additional platform-specific work.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is Flutter suitable for enterprise applications?",
      a: "Yes — Flutter is increasingly used for enterprise mobile applications. Google itself uses Flutter for internal tools. BMW's in-car entertainment system runs on Flutter. Enterprise Flutter deployments benefit from Flutter's consistent cross-platform behaviour (reducing support overhead of platform-specific bugs), Dart's compile-time null safety (reducing runtime crashes in production), and Flutter's strong performance on the range of Android device qualities that enterprise fleets often include. Flutter supports Android Enterprise work profile deployment, MDM-compatible configuration, and enterprise authentication patterns (SAML, OIDC) that enterprise IT environments require. The primary enterprise consideration is the Dart/Flutter talent market — which is smaller than the Swift/Kotlin or React Native/JavaScript markets, though growing rapidly.",
    },
    {
      q: "How does Flutter compare to native development for App Store and Google Play Store quality standards?",
      a: "Flutter apps meet App Store and Google Play Store quality standards — including Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (through Flutter's Cupertino widget library and platform-adaptive patterns) and Google's Material Design guidelines (through Flutter's Material 3 implementation). The App Store review process for Flutter apps is identical to native apps: Apple reviews the compiled binary, not the source language or framework. Flutter apps have received App Store featuring and Editor's Choice recognition — the same quality signals that native apps can earn. The primary App Store consideration is privacy manifest compliance and privacy nutrition label accuracy, which apply equally to Flutter and native apps.",
    },
    {
      q: "When would you recommend React Native over Flutter?",
      a: "React Native is preferable to Flutter when: the development team has strong JavaScript/React expertise and no Dart experience (reducing technology transition cost), the project requires deep integration with existing web React codebase through shared component libraries, the app's functionality is straightforward and visual design does not require Flutter's custom rendering capability, or the app needs to tap into the larger React Native plugin ecosystem for specific integrations that Flutter's pub.dev ecosystem does not yet adequately cover. For apps where animation quality, visual design sophistication, or consistent performance across a wide device range are primary requirements, Flutter is typically the better choice.",
