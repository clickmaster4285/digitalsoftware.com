      q: "What is the difference between Jetpack Compose and the old Android View system?",
      a: "The Android View system (XML layouts with View classes and RecyclerViews) was the primary Android UI development approach from Android's launch through approximately 2021. Jetpack Compose is Google's modern declarative UI toolkit introduced in 2021 — it replaces XML layouts with composable functions written in Kotlin, producing code that is significantly more concise, more readable, and easier to test. For new Android projects in 2026, Jetpack Compose is the standard — Google no longer recommends the View system for new development. For existing apps built with the View system, Compose can be incrementally adopted alongside existing View-based code, enabling migration without a full rewrite.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do you handle Android's device fragmentation?",
      a: "Android fragmentation — the wide variety of screen sizes, display densities, OS versions, and manufacturer customisations — is managed through several practices. We design responsive layouts using ConstraintLayout and Compose's adaptive layout APIs that respond correctly to any screen size. We target a minimum SDK version that covers the required percentage of the target audience based on Google Play's distribution data. We test against a device matrix using Firebase Test Lab — automated testing on real physical devices representing the range of screen sizes, Android versions, and manufacturers relevant to the app's target market. We pay specific attention to manufacturer-specific behaviours on Samsung, Xiaomi, and OnePlus devices in the markets we serve.",

      q: "How long does Android app development take?",
      a: "A simple Android utility app (limited features, no complex backend) typically takes 10-14 weeks from kick-off to Play Store submission. A mid-complexity business app (e-commerce, booking, or delivery app with user accounts, payment, and push notifications) typically takes 16-24 weeks. A complex enterprise or healthcare app with significant backend complexity and Google platform API integration typically takes 24-40 weeks. Play Store review for new apps typically takes 3-7 business days; updates typically review in 1-3 business days.",

A complex enterprise app with significant backend complexity and Google platform integration typically costs $160,000 to $450,000. For projects that require both Android and iOS, a native Android + native iOS engagement typically costs 180-200% of a single-platform engagement; a cross-platform React Native or Flutter engagement typically costs 120-140% of a single-platform engagement. We provide detailed estimates after a scoping consultation.",

      q: "Should I build for both Android and iOS, or launch on one platform first?",
      a: "The right approach depends on your target market and validation strategy. For markets where Android is dominant (UAE, Pakistan, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Africa), Android-first makes strategic sense — reaching the majority of the addressable audience with the first launch. For markets where iOS has significant market share (USA, UK, Australia) and where the iOS user segment is commercially most important (premium consumer products, finance, healthcare), iOS-first or simultaneous launch is more appropriate. For startups validating product-market fit with limited budgets, single-platform launch (on the platform where the primary target audience is concentrated) with cross-platform expansion after validation is typically the most capital-efficient approach.",
