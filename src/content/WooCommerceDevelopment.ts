Unlimited customisation: WooCommerce's open-source architecture means there is no ceiling on what can be built. If the platform's standard functionality does not serve the requirement, custom development can add exactly the functionality needed. Content integration: WooCommerce is a WordPress plugin and the e-commerce store operates within the same WordPress installation as the business's content, blog, documentation, and knowledge base, with a single CMS managing both. No platform commissions: Shopify charges a transaction fee on sales processed through third-party payment gateways (between 0.5% and 2% depending on the plan).

A WooCommerce store with custom product types, complex ordering workflows, subscription systems, or B2B functionality typically costs $30,000 to $80,000. Performance optimisation engagements for underperforming WooCommerce stores typically cost $3,000 to $10,000.

      q: "Is WooCommerce secure for processing payments?",
      a: "WooCommerce processes payments through payment gateway plugins the actual card data handling is performed by the payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal, etc.), not by WooCommerce itself. When implemented correctly, WooCommerce does not store or transmit card data making PCI DSS compliance achievable without the full SAQ D assessment burden. The specific compliance level required depends on how the payment gateway is integrated. We implement payment processing on WooCommerce using the gateway's hosted fields or redirect approach that minimises PCI scope, and we review each implementation against PCI DSS requirements as standard practice."

    {
      q: "Can WooCommerce handle large product catalogs?",
      a: "WooCommerce scales to large catalogs with the right database and query optimisation. The standard WooCommerce product query architecture begins to show performance limitations at 1,000+ SKUs without optimisation. With appropriate product query caching, database indexing, search integration (Elasticsearch or Algolia replacing WooCommerce's standard search), and the correct server infrastructure, WooCommerce stores with 10,000+ SKUs can perform well. The specific performance engineering required depends on the catalog structure, the query patterns of the store's navigation and filtering, and the hosting environment.

Wholesale customers are identified through their user role or customer group, and the store's pricing rules, minimum order quantities, payment terms, and checkout flow adapt accordingly.

    title: "Ready to Build the WooCommerce Store That Handles What Other Platforms Cannot?",
    description: "WooCommerce's flexibility is genuinely exceptional. The ability to model any product type, implement any ordering workflow, own the data completely, and integrate with any system the business uses these are capabilities that no managed e-commerce platform can replicate.\n\nBut flexibility is only valuable when it is implemented correctly. WooCommerce built without performance engineering is slow. WooCommerce built with plugin proliferation is brittle. WooCommerce built without proper security hardening is vulnerable. And WooCommerce built as a template rather than as a platform never delivers the flexibility it promises.\n\nWe build WooCommerce as a platform with the performance, security, and code quality that makes flexibility genuinely useful.",
