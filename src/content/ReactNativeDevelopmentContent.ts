  faqs: [
    {
      q: "What is React Native and how does it differ from Flutter?",
      a: "React Native is a cross-platform mobile framework created by Meta that uses JavaScript and React to build apps rendering native iOS and Android UI components. Flutter is created by Google using the Dart language and a custom rendering engine (Skia/Impeller) drawing its own UI. Key differences: React Native apps render native iOS and Android UI components (making them feel platform-native but occasionally limited by the native component set), while Flutter apps render custom UI (making them visually identical across platforms but requiring more effort for platform-native feel). React Native has the advantage of JavaScript familiarity and a larger ecosystem; Flutter has consistent cross-platform visual fidelity and better animation performance. We develop in both frameworks and recommend based on specific project requirements.",
    },
    {
      q: "How close is React Native's performance to native apps?",
      a: "With the New Architecture (JSI, Fabric, and TurboModules — available since 2024), React Native performance is close to native for most business app use cases. The JavaScript bridge causing performance issues has been replaced with synchronous native calls via JSI, and Fabric runs UI updates directly on the native thread. For complex animations, React Native Reanimated runs animation logic on the native thread, achieving 60fps parity with native. Remaining performance gaps are most visible in apps with extreme UI complexity or those needing consistent performance on very low-end devices where the JavaScript runtime has more overhead than native code.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can React Native access all iOS and Android features?",
      a: "React Native provides access to most commonly-used iOS and Android APIs through built-in modules and the library ecosystem. For platform capabilities not covered by existing libraries, custom native modules written in Swift/Kotlin expose native APIs to JavaScript. The Expo ecosystem provides pre-built native modules covering most common requirements (camera, location, push notifications, sensors, biometrics, in-app purchases) without native code maintenance. Some platform APIs lag native development — typically very new platform features taking 6-18 months to reach production-ready library support.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do over-the-air updates work and what are their limitations?",
      a: "Over-the-air (OTA) updates use services like Expo EAS Update to push new JavaScript bundles directly to installed apps without store review. When a user opens the app, it checks for available OTA updates and downloads them. OTA updates are limited to JavaScript changes — they cannot update native code, add new native modules, or change the app's binary. Changes requiring native code updates still need full store release. Both Apple and Google permit OTA JavaScript updates within platform policies, provided updates do not change core functionality in ways that would trigger additional review.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long does a React Native app take to build?",
      a: "A simple React Native app (limited screens, no complex backend) typically takes 10-14 weeks from kick-off to store submission for both platforms — comparable to single-platform native. A mid-complexity React Native app (e-commerce, marketplace, booking with accounts, payment, push notifications) typically takes 14-20 weeks for both platforms. A complex app (logistics, fintech, healthcare with significant backend complexity) typically takes 20-32 weeks. The primary timeline advantage over dual-native is one codebase, not two — QA, design, and business logic work is not duplicated.",
    },
    {
      q: "How much does React Native development cost compared to native?",
      a: "React Native development for both iOS and Android typically costs 120-140% of a single-platform native engagement — significantly less than the 180-200% cost of separate native iOS and Android development. For a project where native iOS would cost $100,000 and native Android an additional $80,000 (total $180,000), React Native for both platforms might cost $130,000-$150,000 — saving $30,000-$50,000 while achieving simultaneous dual-platform delivery. The cost advantage is most significant for apps where most functionality is the same on both platforms; it reduces for apps with significant platform-specific feature requirements.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you provide ongoing React Native maintenance and updates?",
      a: "Yes — React Native apps require ongoing maintenance: React Native version updates (upgrading the framework version as new releases improve performance and add capabilities), Expo SDK version updates (for Expo-managed apps), dependency updates (maintaining library compatibility), iOS and Android OS version compatibility testing and updates, and feature development in ongoing sprint retainers. We structure post-launch React Native maintenance as monthly retainers covering all maintenance requirements alongside ongoing feature development.",
    },
    {
      q: "When would you recommend native development over React Native?",
      a: "We recommend native iOS or Android development (rather than React Native) when: the app requires deep integration with platform-specific APIs that React Native cannot adequately support (complex custom camera processing, background audio with sophisticated routing, AR Foundation usage beyond basic ARKit/ARCore features), the performance requirements are so stringent that JavaScript runtime overhead is a problem even with the New Architecture (real-time multiplayer game rendering, complex signal processing), or the target audience is so strongly concentrated on a single platform that cross-platform development produces no return on supporting both.",

    {
      q: "How do I get started?",
      a: "Book a free cross-platform app consultation. We discuss your app requirements, your target audience across iOS and Android, the features you need, and whether React Native is the right approach or whether native development better serves your specific requirements.
